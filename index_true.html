								I’m a second year undergraduate student completing a Physics honours degree with a major in Mathematics at Bishop’s University. I am the Senior Editor for the Natural Sciences and Mathematics for the Bishop’s Undergraduate Research Journal, and a co-lead for the Astronomy, Mathematics & Physics Society. I am also serving as the Chair of the Inclusivity & Diversity Committee at the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada. In my free time, I like to read, write, practice yoga and knit.
